Ultrasonic Sensor

Sketch:
int trigger=7; // "trigger on the pin 7"
int echo=6;    // "echo" on pin 6.
long time=0;   // The value "time" will save the time between transmission and reception of      soundwave.
long dist=0;   // The value "dist" will save the calculated distance. It will start with 0.
                        // Instead of int we are using "long" for this value, to save bigger number.
// #define LED 11

void setup() {
  /*Starting the serial communication. It will send the data from the arduino board to the
  computer to show it on the serial monitor.*/
  Serial.begin (9600); 
  pinMode(trigger, OUTPUT);  //”trigger” (Pin 7) is an output.
  pinMode(echo, INPUT);  // ”echo” (Pin 6) is an input.
}

void loop()  {
  digitalWrite(trigger, LOW);  //Low voltage on the trigger pin to produce a clear signal.
  delay(5); //for 5 milliseconds.
  digitalWrite(trigger, HIGH); //Creating the soundwave.
  delay(10); //..for 10 milliseconds.
  digitalWrite(trigger, LOW); //Stop creating the soundwave.
  
  /*With the command pulseIn (Capital “i” in the //front of the “n”) the arduino board measures 
  the time between sending and receiving the soundwave.*/
  time = pulseIn(echo, HIGH); 
  
  /*This calculation transforms the measured time into the distance in centimeter.
  (The sound needs 29.1 milli seconds for one centimeter. The time gets divided with two, 
  because we only want to get one distance and not the two ways that the soundwave has to take).*/
  dist = (time/2) / 29.1;
  
  if (dist >= 500 || dist <= 0) {
    //If the distance gets over 500cm OR under 0cm, the measurement is no longer accurate.
    Serial.println("No measurement");

  }

    Serial.println("cm");
    Serial.println(" ");
  }
